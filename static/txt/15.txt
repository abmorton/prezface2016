'Our debt now equals our entire economy.'
'I will not give this President or any President to power to borrow unspecified amounts of money.'
"I promised the voters of Kentucky to oppose deficits, to oppose budgets that don't balance, and to spend only what we have."
'This a bipartisan busting of the budget caps that will further indenture the next generation.'
